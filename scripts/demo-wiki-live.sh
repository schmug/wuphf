# ── Beat 1: CEO creates a new customer brief ────────────────────────

  "first meridian brief" \
  "# Meridian Freight

**Meridian Freight** is a 120-person logistics company in Columbus. Warm intro via [[people/sarah-chen]] who ran ops for them 2019-2022.

## Current state

Sarah forwarded a note from their COO flagging dispatcher burnout. Six open reqs they can't fill. Same pattern as [[customers/customer-x]] — manual AM schedule-rebuild every day.

## Next

Discovery call scheduled 2026-04-24. See [[playbooks/mid-market-first-call]]."

# ── Beat 2: PM updates existing playbook with meridian reference ───

  "# Churn prevention

References [[customers/customer-x]] and [[customers/meridian-freight]] as renewal-risk cases.

## When to trigger

- Mid-market pilots approaching 90-day renewal
- Champion at customer flags timing pressure
- Contract under \$100k (smaller deals churn faster)
- **NEW:** dispatcher-burnout signal (seen at Customer X, forming at Meridian)

## Playbook steps

1. Two weeks before renewal: renewal-prep email to champion
2. One week before: 20-min check-in with champion + their manager
3. Day of: confirmation of next year or negotiated extension
4. **NEW:** if the dispatcher-burnout signal fires, escalate to CEO +7 days"

write "growth" "team/decisions/2026-q2-pricing.md" "create" \

  "# 2026-Q2 pricing

Read-only dispatcher seats are 30% of full seat price. This unblocks [[customers/customer-x]] seat-expansion and removes the same objection for [[customers/meridian-freight]].

## Rationale

Two pilots hit the same wall in Q1. Viewer seats were hacked around with shared logins. 30% gives customers a clear upgrade ladder without cannibalizing the primary seat.

## Scope

- Effective 2026-05-01
- Legacy contracts grandfathered for 6 months
- New pilots signed after 2026-05-01 use the new sheet"

Director of Ops at [[customers/customer-x]]. Former VP Operations at [[customers/meridian-freight]] (2019-2022).

## Why she matters

Our strongest champion at Customer X. Quarterly performance review on 2026-Q3 — see [[playbooks/churn-prevention]] for the timing-pressure play.

## Preferences

- Prefers Tuesday mornings for check-ins
- Replies faster in Slack than email
- Does NOT want the CEO cold-called"

## Update — 2026-04-19

Seeing the same dispatcher-burnout signal we just noted at [[customers/meridian-freight]]. Means the [[playbooks/onboarding-wedge-thesis]] is landing consistently across mid-market logistics. See the new entry in [[playbooks/churn-prevention]]."

# ── Beat 6: Builder writes a tech decision ──────────────────────────
write "builder" "team/decisions/wiki-as-default.md" "create" \
  "wiki as default memory" \
  "# Wiki as default memory

As of this week, new installs default to the markdown wiki instead of the Nex knowledge graph.

## Why

- Users can \`cat\` and \`git clone\` their team memory
- No API key required to try it
- File-over-app story matches WUPHF's MIT/self-hosted posture

## What it means

- Existing Nex/GBrain users unaffected (backend switch is config-pinned)
- Four new MCP tools (\`team_wiki_read/search/list/write\`) replace \`team_memory_*\` when \`WUPHF_MEMORY_BACKEND=markdown\`

See [[decisions/2026-q2-pricing]] for the related commercial thinking."

# ── Beat 7: PM updates renewal playbook ─────────────────────────────
write "planner" "team/playbooks/renewal.md" "replace" \
  "renewal playbook concrete next steps" \
  "# Renewal and retention

Our goal: 90%+ gross retention on mid-market pilots.

## Signals to watch

- Champion career pressure (see [[people/sarah-chen]])
- Dispatcher-burnout proxy metrics (see [[customers/customer-x]])
- Delayed response to renewal-prep email (≥ 3 days = escalate)

## Steps

1. 30 days before renewal: champion + sponsor mapping refreshed
2. 14 days: prep email + calendar hold
3. 7 days: check-in call
4. Day of: close

VP Engineering at [[customers/customer-x]]. Reports into Mike Reyes (VPO). Not a day-to-day contact — but reviews every MSA before [[customers/customer-x]]'s legal signs off.
