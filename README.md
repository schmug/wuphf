### A terminal office where your AI team works in the open.

One command. One shared office. CEO, PM, engineers, designer, CMO, CRO — all visible, arguing, claiming tasks, and shipping work instead of disappearing behind an API. Unlike the original WUPHF.com, this one works.

## Get Started

**Prerequisites:** one agent CLI — [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) by default, or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) when you pass `--provider codex`. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) is only required for `--tui` mode.

```bash
npx wuphf
```

That's it. The browser opens automatically and you're in the office. Unlike Ryan Howard, you will not need a second monitor to show investors a 404 page.

Prefer a global install?

```bash
npm install -g wuphf && wuphf
```

Building from source (requires Go):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nex-crm/wuphf.git
cd wuphf
go build -o wuphf ./cmd/wuphf
./wuphf
```

> **Forking this?** See [FORKING.md](FORKING.md) for running WUPHF without Nex, swapping branding, and adding your own agent packs. For the internals, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

> **Stability:** pre-1.0. `main` moves daily. Pin your fork to a release tag, not `main`.

## Options

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--memory-backend <name>` | Pick the organizational memory backend (`nex`, `gbrain`, `none`) |
| `--no-nex` | Skip the Nex backend (no context graph, no Nex-managed integrations) |
| `--tui` | Use the tmux TUI instead of the web UI |
| `--no-open` | Don't auto-open the browser |
| `--pack <name>` | Pick an agent pack (`starter`, `founding-team`, `coding-team`, `lead-gen-agency`, `revops`) |
| `--opus-ceo` | Upgrade CEO from Sonnet to Opus |
| `--provider <name>` | LLM provider override (`claude-code`, `codex`) |
| `--collab` | Start in collaborative mode — all agents see all messages (this is the default) |
| `--unsafe` | Bypass agent permission checks (local dev only) |
| `--web-port <n>` | Change the web UI port (default 7891) |

`--no-nex` still lets Telegram and any other local integration keep working. To switch back to CEO-routed delegation after launch, use `/focus` inside the office.

## Memory Backends

WUPHF can run with three organizational context modes:

- `nex` is the default. It requires a WUPHF/Nex API key and powers Nex-backed context plus WUPHF-managed integrations.
- `gbrain` mounts `gbrain serve` as the office memory layer. It requires an API key during `/init`: `OpenAI` gives you the full path with embeddings and vector search, while `Anthropic` alone is reduced mode.
- `none` disables the external memory layer entirely.

WUPHF now enforces two memory scopes above those backends:

- `private` memory is per-agent and local to WUPHF. Every agent can query and write its own notes.
- `shared` memory is workspace-wide and backed by the selected external backend (`nex` or `gbrain`).

Agents use WUPHF-managed memory tools instead of talking to raw backend MCP tools directly. That gives the same scope model across both backends:

- every agent can read shared memory
- every agent can read and write only its own private memory
- durable conclusions can be promoted from private memory into shared memory once they are real
- shared memory can point agents at the teammate who last recorded durable context, so they know who to ask in-channel for fresher working detail
- private notes that look like durable decisions, preferences, or playbooks get promotion hints, but nothing is promoted automatically

Examples:

```bash
wuphf --memory-backend nex
wuphf --memory-backend gbrain
wuphf --memory-backend none
```

When you select `gbrain`, onboarding asks for an OpenAI or Anthropic key up front and explains the tradeoff. If you want embeddings and vector search, use OpenAI.

## Other Commands

The examples below assume `wuphf` is on your `PATH`. If you just built the binary and haven't moved it, prefix with `./` (as in Get Started above) or run `go install ./cmd/wuphf` to drop it in `$GOPATH/bin`.

```bash
wuphf init          # First-time setup
wuphf shred         # Kill a running session
wuphf --1o1         # 1:1 with the CEO
wuphf --1o1 cro     # 1:1 with a specific agent
```

## What You Should See

- A browser tab at `localhost:7891` with the office
- `#general` as the shared channel
- The team visible and working
- A composer to send messages and slash commands

If it feels like a hidden agent loop, something is wrong. If it feels like The Office, you're exactly where you need to be.

## Telegram Bridge

WUPHF can bridge to Telegram. Run `/connect` inside the office, pick Telegram, paste your bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), and select a group or DM. Messages flow both ways.

## OpenClaw Bridge

Already running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agents? You can bring them into the WUPHF office.

Inside the office, run `/connect openclaw`, paste your gateway URL (default `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`) and the `gateway.auth.token` from your `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, then pick which sessions to bridge. Each becomes a first-class office member you can `@mention`. OpenClaw agents keep running in their own sandbox; WUPHF just gives them a shared office to collaborate in.

WUPHF authenticates to the gateway using an Ed25519 keypair (persisted at `~/.wuphf/openclaw/identity.json`, 0600), signed against the server-issued nonce during every connect. OpenClaw grants zero scopes to token-only clients, so device pairing is mandatory — on loopback the gateway approves silently on first use.

## External Actions

To let agents take real actions (send emails, update CRMs, etc.), WUPHF ships with two action providers. Pick whichever fits your style.

### One CLI — default, local-first

Uses a local CLI binary to execute actions on your machine. Good if you want everything running locally and don't want to send credentials to a third party.

```
/config set action_provider one
```

### Composio — cloud-hosted

Connects SaaS accounts (Gmail, Slack, etc.) through Composio's hosted OAuth flows. Good if you'd rather not manage local CLI auth.

1. Create a [Composio](https://composio.dev) project and generate an API key.
2. Connect the accounts you want (Gmail, Slack, etc.).
3. Inside the office:
   ```
   /config set composio_api_key <key>
   /config set action_provider composio
   ```

## Why WUPHF

| Feature | How it works |
|---|---|
| Sessions | Fresh per turn (no accumulated context) |
| Tools | Per-agent scoped (DM loads 4, full office loads 27) |
| Agent wakes | Push-driven (zero idle burn) |
| Live visibility | Stdout streaming |
| Mid-task steering | DM any agent, no restart |
| Runtimes | Mix Claude Code, Codex, and OpenClaw in one channel |
| Memory | Per-agent knowledge graph + shared workspace memory |
| Price | Free and open source (MIT, self-hosted, your API keys) |

## Benchmark

10-turn CEO session on Codex. All numbers measured from live runs.

| Metric | WUPHF |
|---|---|
| Input per turn | Flat ~87k tokens |
| Billed per turn (after cache) | ~40k tokens |
| 10-turn total | ~286k tokens |
| Cache hit rate | 97% (Claude API prompt cache) |
| Claude Code cost (5-turn) | $0.06 |
| Idle token burn | Zero (push-driven, no polling) |

Accumulated-session orchestrators grow from 124k to 484k input per turn over the same session. WUPHF stays flat. 7x difference measured over 8 turns.

**Fresh sessions.** Each agent turn starts clean. No conversation history accumulates.

**Prompt caching.** Claude Code gets 97% cache read because identical prompt prefixes across fresh sessions align with Anthropic's prompt cache.

**Per-role tools.** DM mode loads 4 MCP tools instead of 27. Fewer tool schemas = smaller prompt = better cache hits.

**Zero idle burn.** Agents only spawn when the broker pushes a notification. No heartbeat polling.

### Reproduce it

```bash
wuphf --pack starter &
./scripts/benchmark.sh
```

All numbers are live-measured on your machine with your keys.

## Evaluate This Repo

Before you fork, run this prompt against the codebase with any AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.). It tells the assistant to play a cynical senior engineer doing a fork-or-skip review — no marketing spin, just file paths, line numbers, and a verdict in under 500 words. Drop it in, read the answer, decide.

```
You are a cynical senior engineer evaluating whether to fork this repo as the
base for a multi-agent terminal office product. No prior context — explore it
as you naturally would. Tell me: should I fork this, and what's your honest
take? Be specific: file paths, line numbers, actual evidence. "The docs are
bad" is useless. Under 500 words.
```

We run this ourselves before every release. If the AI finds something we missed, [file an issue](https://github.com/nex-crm/wuphf/issues).

## The Name

From [*The Office*](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/WUPHF.com_(Website)), Season 7. Ryan Howard's startup that reached people via phone, text, email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, and then... WUPHF. Michael Scott invested $10,000. Ryan burned through it. The site went offline.

The joke still fits. Except this WUPHF ships.



> *"I invested ten thousand dollars in WUPHF. Just need one good quarter."*
> — Michael Scott

Michael: still waiting on that quarter. We are not.
