# WUPHF

WUPHF is a weird little terminal office for a team of AI coworkers.

You run one command, it opens one tmux window, and suddenly you have a CEO, PM, frontend engineer, backend engineer, AI engineer, designer, CMO, and CRO all sitting in the same place arguing about what to build. That is the product.

The name is from *The Office*. If you know, you know. If you do not, this is the bit:

- https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/WUPHF.com_(Website)

The joke still fits. It is one thing hitting a bunch of people at once.

## What This Actually Does

- gives the team one shared channel: `#general`
- shows live agent panes in the same tmux window
- keeps discussions in threads so the main channel does not become soup
- lets the team pause and ask you a real blocking question
- keeps a real office task list and request queue so not everyone dogpiles the same thing
- separates company defaults from live office state, so the office has a stable roster/channels and a separate “what is happening right now” layer
- can optionally use Nex for memory, notifications, and integrations

This is not “one chatbot with a fancy prompt.” The point is to make the team visible.

## What You Need

Install these first:

- `tmux`
- `claude`
- Go

If you want Nex features too, also install:

- `nex`
- `nex-mcp`

## Nex Is Optional

Nex makes WUPHF better, but it is not mandatory.

If you do not want context graph stuff, integrations, or notifications, just run:

```bash
./wuphf --no-nex
```

That turns Nex off for that run.

What you lose:

- context graph reads and writes
- Nex-powered notifications
- Nex integrations
- any need to configure a Nex API key

What you keep:

- the office
- the channel
- the team
- the arguments

## Company State

WUPHF now has two different kinds of state on purpose:

- company manifest: who is on the team and which channels exist by default
- live office state: messages, tasks, requests, disabled members, costs, cursors, and in-flight work

The company manifest lives at:

```text
~/.wuphf/company.json
```

If that file does not exist, WUPHF falls back to the built-in founding team.

## Requests, Not Just Interviews

The office now has a real request system.

That means the team can open:

- approvals
- confirmations
- freeform questions
- private/secret answers
- classic blocking interviews

The old blocking interview behavior still works, but under the hood it is now just one kind of request.

So no, this repo is not trying to trap people into using Nex. If you want the multi-agent office without it, that is supported on purpose.

## Build

```bash
go build -o wuphf ./cmd/wuphf
```

## Run

Start the office:

```bash
./wuphf
```

Start it with Nex disabled:

```bash
./wuphf --no-nex
```

Kill a running session from outside tmux:

```bash
./wuphf kill
```

## Setup

WUPHF setup installs the latest published CLI automatically.

Outside the UI:

```bash
./wuphf init
```

Inside the office:

```text
/init
```

If for some reason you want the published CLI separately, there is still a script for that:

```bash
bash scripts/install-latest-wuphf-cli.sh
```

## What You Should See

When it works, you should get:

- one tmux window
- `The WUPHF Office` at the top
- `# general` as the shared channel
- the team visible in panes
- a working composer in the channel pane

If it feels like a hidden agent loop, something is wrong.

## Quick Manual Test

Build:

```bash
go build -o wuphf ./cmd/wuphf
```

Launch:

```bash
./wuphf
```

Then check a few basics:

- type `/` and make sure slash autocomplete opens
- type `/qui` and hit `Enter`; it should submit `/quit`
- type `@` and make sure teammate autocomplete opens
- use `/reply <message-id>` to reply inside a thread
- use `/requests` and make sure open requests are visible
- use `/reset` and make sure the office clears without killing the channel pane

If Nex is enabled, leave the office running long enough for the CEO insight sweep and make sure:

- Nex summaries land in `#general`
- the CEO assigns tasks instead of just dumping a wall of text
- if something really needs a human decision, it opens a request instead of guessing

## Automated Tests

Channel smoke:

```bash
bash tests/uat/office-channel-e2e.sh
```

Full office flow:

```bash
bash tests/uat/notetaker-e2e.sh
```

## A Few Notes

- The binary lives in `./cmd/wuphf`.
- Local office/team tools are Go-native and run from the same binary through an internal subcommand.
- WUPHF does not need Bun anymore.
- Nex-specific code is kept only where it is actually about Nex.

In other words: this repo is the office, not a pile of leftover CLI baggage wearing a fake mustache.
