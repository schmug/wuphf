				Trigger:     "When asked to audit the CRM, check data quality, or find stale records",
				Content: `You are performing a CRM hygiene audit. Your goal is to surface data quality issues so the team can keep the CRM accurate and actionable.

## What to do

1. **Query Nex for CRM context**: Ask Nex "What contacts or companies in our CRM have incomplete or stale data?" and "What are the most common data quality issues in our pipeline?"

2. **Identify the worst offenders** across these dimensions:
   - Contacts missing email, phone, or job title
   - Companies missing industry, size, or website
   - Open deals with no activity in 14+ days
   - Deals missing close date or next step
   - Leads with no owner assigned

3. **Prioritize by revenue impact**: Focus first on open deals and high-value accounts. A stale $200k opportunity matters more than a missing phone number on a cold contact.

4. **Structure your output** as a prioritized list:
   - Critical (blocks forecasting): deals missing close date, stage, or ARR
   - High (degrades pipeline quality): open opps with no recent activity
   - Medium (reduces signal): contacts missing key fields
   - Low (nice-to-have): cosmetic or optional fields

5. **For each issue**, include: what's missing, how many records affected, and a recommended fix action.

6. **Propose fixes** where you can automate them (e.g., enrichment via known data sources, bulk updates to assignee). Gate destructive changes (bulk delete, stage resets) on human approval via a human_interview.

## Output format

Post findings to #general as a summary table with issue, count, impact, and recommended action. If using Composio to make CRM updates, confirm the change count before executing.`,

				Name:        "Meeting Prep Brief",
				Title:       "Meeting Prep Brief",
				Description: "Prepare reps with a concise brief before customer or prospect meetings",
				Tags:        []string{"sales", "meetings", "prep", "crm"},
				Trigger:     "When asked to prep for a meeting, generate a brief, or summarize a prospect before a call",
				Content: `You are preparing a meeting brief for an upcoming sales or customer call. Your goal is to give the rep everything they need to walk in sharp.

## What to do

1. **Identify the meeting**: Who is it with? What company? What stage is the deal or relationship?

2. **Query Nex for context**:
   - Ask "What do we know about [company name] — their business, buying signals, and recent activity?"
   - Ask "What is the current status of our relationship or deal with [company name]?"
   - Ask "Are there any open action items, blockers, or commitments from previous interactions?"

3. **Pull CRM data** (via Composio if configured):
   - Last interaction date and type (email, call, demo)
   - Deal stage, ARR, close date
   - Key stakeholders and their roles
   - Any recorded objections or concerns

4. **Research the prospect** (if first meeting):
   - Company size, industry, recent news
   - Known tech stack or competitive tools in use
   - ICP fit score if lead scoring is active

5. **Build the brief** with these sections:
   - **Who you're meeting**: Name, title, company, decision-maker status
   - **Where we are**: Deal stage, last touch, next step on file
   - **Context from Nex**: Buying signals, known pain points, company priorities
   - **Your agenda**: 2-3 suggested talking points based on where the deal is
   - **Watch-outs**: Open objections, competitor mentions, any red flags
   - **Ask**: The one clear ask for this call (demo booked, POC scoped, legal introduced, etc.)

6. **Keep it under one page**. If the rep has to scroll past the fold, it's too long.

Post the brief to #general tagged with the rep's name and meeting time.`,

				Name:        "Closed-Lost Re-engagement",
				Title:       "Closed-Lost Re-engagement",
				Description: "Re-engage closed-lost deals that may be ready to revisit",
				Tags:        []string{"sales", "re-engagement", "closed-lost", "outbound"},
				Trigger:     "When asked to find re-engagement opportunities, surface closed-lost deals, or run a win-back campaign",
				Content: `You are running a closed-lost re-engagement motion. Your goal is to find deals that went cold but may now be worth revisiting, and draft outreach that's worth opening.

## What to do

1. **Query Nex for signal**:
   - Ask "Are there any closed-lost deals where the company has since had a leadership change, funding event, or relevant trigger?"
   - Ask "Which lost deals had the most positive engagement before they closed-lost?"
   - Ask "What were the most common reasons we lost deals in the last 6 months?"

2. **Filter closed-lost deals** by re-engagement potential:
   - Lost 3-18 months ago (not too fresh, not too stale)
   - Lost reason was timing, budget, or internal priority — not product fit
   - Company has had a trigger event: new funding, new exec, product launch, or hiring surge
   - Deal size was meaningful (above your ACV floor)

3. **Score each opportunity** (1-5):
   - 5: Strong fit, timing trigger, positive prior relationship
   - 3: Good fit, no clear trigger, but worth a touch
   - 1: Bad fit or hard no — skip entirely

4. **Draft re-engagement messages** for each scored 4+:
   - Reference the specific trigger event ("I saw you just raised a Series B...")
   - Acknowledge the prior conversation briefly without being weird about it
   - Lead with what's changed on your side (new capability, customer win in their space, etc.)
   - One clear ask: 20-minute catch-up, not a full demo

5. **Gate sending** on human approval: present the draft list with scores and messages via human_interview before any outreach is sent.

Output a re-engagement queue with: company, deal size, lost reason, trigger event, score, and draft message. Post to #general.`,

				Name:        "Deals Going Dark",
				Title:       "Deals Going Dark",
				Description: "Surface active pipeline deals with no recent activity before they go cold",
				Tags:        []string{"pipeline", "sales", "alerts", "crm"},
				Trigger:     "When asked to check pipeline health, find stalled deals, or surface deals with no recent activity",
				Content: `You are running a pipeline health check to surface deals at risk of going dark before they're formally lost.

## What to do

1. **Query Nex for deal context**:
   - Ask "Which of our open deals have had no recent activity or contact?"
   - Ask "Are there any deals where the champion has gone quiet or changed roles?"
   - Ask "What deals are approaching their close date without a clear next step?"

2. **Pull open pipeline** (via Composio if configured):
   - Filter deals with no logged activity (call, email, meeting) in 10+ days
   - Flag deals where close date is within 30 days but no next step is set
   - Flag deals where the primary contact hasn't responded to the last 2 touches

3. **Assess risk by stage**:
   - Late stage (proposal/negotiation) going dark: critical — flag immediately
   - Mid stage (demo/evaluation) going dark: high — needs a nudge within 48 hours
   - Early stage (discovery) going dark: medium — assess fit before re-investing

4. **For each at-risk deal**, diagnose the likely cause:
   - Champion went quiet: internal blocker, competing priority, or lost sponsor
   - No next step: last meeting ended without a commitment
   - Approaching close date: artificial deadline that wasn't real, or deal is slipping

5. **Recommend a specific action** for each deal:
   - "Send a 'just checking in' with a clear ask"
   - "Reach out to a second stakeholder to triangulate"
   - "Propose a 2-week extension and reset the close date"
   - "Mark at-risk in CRM and flag for forecast call"

6. **Post a pipeline health report** to #general:
   - Red (critical, needs action today): deal name, stage, days dark, recommended action
   - Amber (needs attention this week): same format
   - Green (healthy): summary count only

				Trigger:     "When asked to score leads, prioritize inbound, or identify best-fit prospects",
				Content: `You are scoring inbound leads to help the team focus time on the prospects most likely to convert.

## What to do

1. **Query Nex for ICP and playbook context**:
   - Ask "What does our ideal customer profile look like — industry, size, buying signals?"
   - Ask "What are the strongest indicators that a lead is ready to buy?"
   - Ask "Which lead sources have historically converted best?"

2. **Pull the lead list** (via Composio if configured):
   - Unworked leads added in the last 14 days
   - Leads that re-engaged (opened email, visited pricing page, booked a demo)
   - MQLs that haven't been contacted within 48 hours

3. **Score each lead** across two dimensions:

   **Fit score (1-5)** — how well do they match the ICP?
   - 5: Perfect match on industry, size, and use case
   - 3: Partial match — one dimension off
   - 1: Clear mismatch — wrong segment

   **Intent score (1-5)** — how ready are they to buy?
   - 5: Demo request, pricing page visit, or inbound inquiry
   - 3: Content download, webinar attendance, or re-engagement
   - 1: Cold list import or conference badge scan

4. **Tier the leads**:
   - Tier 1 (fit 4-5 + intent 3-5): route to AE immediately
   - Tier 2 (fit 3+ + intent 2+): SDR sequence within 24 hours
   - Tier 3 (fit ≤2 or intent 1): nurture or disqualify

5. **For each Tier 1 lead**, include a suggested opening line for the AE based on the lead's company, role, and most recent action.

6. **Post the scored lead list** to #general with: lead name, company, fit score, intent score, tier, and suggested action. Flag any Tier 1 leads that have been sitting more than 24 hours without contact.

Gate any CRM field updates (score, tier, owner assignment) on human approval via human_interview.`,
