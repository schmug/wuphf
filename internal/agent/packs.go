// Skills are provider-agnostic by design. Which backend actually serves a
// call (One CLI or Composio) is decided by the action Registry in
// internal/action/registry.go, not by skill content. One is preferred because
// it is local and personal; Composio is the fallback for tools One does not
// cover. If you need to change provider priority, change it in the Registry,
// not here.
const revopsDriveConnection = `## Step 0: Drive the connection before you start

This skill acts on real company data. Never fabricate deals, contacts, pipeline numbers, or activity. If the required integration is not connected, DRIVE the user through connecting it end-to-end before you do any work.

1. Call **team_action_connections** to see what is already connected. The framework picks the right backend automatically — you do not need to reason about One versus Composio.
2. If what you need is already connected, skip to step 4.
3. The integration is missing. Drive the user through connecting it:
   a. Ask via **human_interview** which tool they use. Give concrete options:
      - CRM: HubSpot, Salesforce, Attio, Pipedrive, Zoho, Close, Copper, Other
      - If the skill also needs email / calendar / outbound, ask for that tool too: Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar, Apollo, Outreach, Salesloft, SendGrid, or manual
   b. Call **team_action_guide** with the tool name. The guide returns step-by-step setup instructions for the backend the framework selected (set a config key, authorize an account, run a CLI command, etc.). Walk the user through each step. Wait for confirmation after each.
   c. Re-call **team_action_connections** to verify. Iterate on failures until connected.
   d. If **team_action_guide** reports that no configured backend supports the tool, offer three options via **human_interview**:
      1. Pick a supported tool instead — list what the guide surfaces for common categories.
      2. Ask you to propose a dedicated skill for the tool. Draft an instruction-based skill that wraps its public API and save it for review.
      3. Provide an API key and base URL for the tool. Save it via ` + "`/config set <tool>_api_key <value>`" + ` and make direct HTTP calls. Gate every write on **human_interview**.
4. Once connected, use **team_action_search** to discover the action slug and **team_action_execute** to run it.

If the user explicitly says "skip" or "work from context only", proceed using Nex and the thread alone. Flag "Data source: thread + Nex only, no live data" at the top of your output so the gap is visible.

` + revopsDriveConnection + `## What to do

1. **Query Nex for context first**: Ask "What contacts, companies, or deals in our CRM are most at risk from data gaps?" Nex may surface patterns before you hit the CRM directly.

2. **Pull live CRM data** via **team_action_execute** using the actions you discovered in Step 0. Audit across:
   - Contacts missing email, phone, or job title
   - Companies missing industry, size, or website
   - Open deals with no activity in 14+ days
   - Deals missing close date or next step
   - Leads with no owner assigned

3. **Prioritize by revenue impact**: a stale $200k opportunity matters more than a missing phone number on a cold contact.

4. **Structure your output** as a prioritized list:
   - Critical (blocks forecasting): deals missing close date, stage, or ARR
   - High (degrades pipeline quality): open opps with no recent activity
   - Medium (reduces signal): contacts missing key fields
   - Low (nice-to-have): cosmetic or optional fields

5. **For each issue**, include: what is missing, how many records, and a recommended fix action.

6. **Propose fixes** where you can automate them. Gate destructive changes (bulk delete, stage resets) on human approval via **human_interview** with the exact change count.

## Output format

Post findings to #general as a summary table with issue, count, impact, and recommended action.`,

				Content: `You are preparing a meeting brief for an upcoming sales or customer call. Your goal is to give the rep everything they need to walk in sharp.

` + revopsDriveConnection + `## What to do

1. **Identify the meeting**: Who is it with? What company? What stage?

2. **Query Nex for context**:
   - "What do we know about [company name] — their business, buying signals, and recent activity?"
   - "What is the current status of our relationship or deal with [company name]?"
   - "Are there any open action items, blockers, or commitments from previous interactions?"

3. **Pull live data** via **team_action_execute** against whatever CRM / calendar / email is connected:
   - Last interaction date and type
   - Deal stage, ARR, close date
   - Key stakeholders and their roles
   - Any recorded objections or concerns

4. **Research the prospect** (if first meeting): company size, industry, recent news, tech stack.

5. **Build the brief** with:
   - **Who you're meeting**: name, title, company, decision-maker status
   - **Where we are**: deal stage, last touch, next step on file
   - **Context from Nex**: buying signals, known pain points, priorities
   - **Your agenda**: 2-3 suggested talking points for the current stage
   - **Watch-outs**: open objections, competitor mentions, red flags, data gaps
   - **Ask**: the one clear ask for this call (demo booked, POC scoped, legal introduced)

6. **Keep it under one page**. If the rep has to scroll past the fold, it is too long.

				Content: `You are running a closed-lost re-engagement motion. Your goal is to find deals that went cold but may now be worth revisiting, and draft outreach that is worth opening.

` + revopsDriveConnection + `## What to do

1. **Query Nex for signal**:
   - "Are there closed-lost deals where the company has since had a leadership change, funding event, or relevant trigger?"
   - "Which lost deals had the most positive engagement before they closed-lost?"
   - "What were the most common reasons we lost deals in the last 6 months?"

2. **Pull closed-lost deals** via **team_action_execute** against the CRM. Filter by:
   - Lost 3-18 months ago (not too fresh, not too stale)
   - Lost reason: timing, budget, or internal priority — not product fit
   - Company has had a trigger event: new funding, new exec, product launch, hiring surge
   - Deal size was meaningful (above your ACV floor)

3. **Score each opportunity** (1-5):
   - 5: strong fit, timing trigger, positive prior relationship
   - 3: good fit, no clear trigger, but worth a touch
   - 1: bad fit or hard no, skip entirely

4. **Draft re-engagement messages** for each scored 4+:
   - Reference the specific trigger event ("I saw you just raised a Series B...")
   - Acknowledge the prior conversation briefly without being weird about it
   - Lead with what has changed on your side
   - One clear ask: 20-minute catch-up, not a full demo

5. **Gate sending** on human approval via **human_interview**. Present the draft list with scores and messages. Never send outbound email without approval.

1. **Query Nex for deal context**:
   - Ask "Which of our open deals have had no recent activity or contact?"
   - Ask "Are there any deals where the champion has gone quiet or changed roles?"
   - Ask "What deals are approaching their close date without a clear next step?"

2. **Pull open pipeline** via **team_action_execute** against the connected CRM:
   - Filter deals with no logged activity (call, email, meeting) in 10+ days
   - Flag deals where close date is within 30 days but no next step is set
   - Flag deals where the primary contact hasn't responded to the last 2 touches

3. **Assess risk by stage**:
   - Late stage (proposal/negotiation) going dark: critical — flag immediately
   - Mid stage (demo/evaluation) going dark: high — needs a nudge within 48 hours
   - Early stage (discovery) going dark: medium — assess fit before re-investing

4. **For each at-risk deal**, diagnose the likely cause:
   - Champion went quiet: internal blocker, competing priority, or lost sponsor
   - No next step: last meeting ended without a commitment
   - Approaching close date: artificial deadline that wasn't real, or deal is slipping

5. **Recommend a specific action** for each deal:
   - "Send a 'just checking in' with a clear ask"
   - "Reach out to a second stakeholder to triangulate"
   - "Propose a 2-week extension and reset the close date"
   - "Mark at-risk in CRM and flag for forecast call"

6. **Post a pipeline health report** to #general:
   - Red (critical, needs action today): deal name, stage, days dark, recommended action
   - Amber (needs attention this week): same format
   - Green (healthy): summary count only

2. **Pull the lead list** via **team_action_execute** against the connected CRM:
   - Unworked leads added in the last 14 days
   - Leads that re-engaged (opened email, visited pricing page, booked a demo)
   - MQLs that haven't been contacted within 48 hours

3. **Score each lead** across two dimensions:

   **Fit score (1-5)** — how well do they match the ICP?
   - 5: Perfect match on industry, size, and use case
   - 3: Partial match — one dimension off
   - 1: Clear mismatch — wrong segment

   **Intent score (1-5)** — how ready are they to buy?
   - 5: Demo request, pricing page visit, or inbound inquiry
   - 3: Content download, webinar attendance, or re-engagement
   - 1: Cold list import or conference badge scan

4. **Tier the leads**:
   - Tier 1 (fit 4-5 + intent 3-5): route to AE immediately
   - Tier 2 (fit 3+ + intent 2+): SDR sequence within 24 hours
   - Tier 3 (fit ≤2 or intent 1): nurture or disqualify

5. **For each Tier 1 lead**, include a suggested opening line for the AE based on the lead's company, role, and most recent action.

6. **Post the scored lead list** to #general with: lead name, company, fit score, intent score, tier, and suggested action. Flag any Tier 1 leads that have been sitting more than 24 hours without contact.
